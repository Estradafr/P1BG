# P1BG
# A Browser Text Based Adventure


## The goal of this game is create my first project.
## I'll be working towards some goals and attempting to make it a fully functional, scalable project.
## As it stands now, I want to create the layout using bootstrap. Then manipulate the button clicks to allow the user to have a playable experience on both mobile and browser.

### The theme of the game will be post apocalpytic. Think of almost the first fallout game! 
### Surely fallout is extremely complex, as fun as it would be to work through that process. For now i'll keep it simple.

### The goals for this games as follows now:

### 1. I want to create a good looking UI.
### This will be done with bootstrap.

### 2. I want to map out the paths that the character could create.
### This will take some creative juice, for now I think 3 buttons that interact with each path can work.
### I would like a modal for each path to pop up; Allowing the user to read it thoroughly before choosing their next step.

### 3. I want to create something that pushes my limit in difficult, without making me feel stuck.
### This can be easily done, I'll have time to make this what I want and I want to exceed my own expectations.

### Thank you for reading I will add more should it come up!
